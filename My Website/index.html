  			<p>Yoshio has been working in a Japanese hospital operating company (CUC Inc.) at their department responsible for international business development for the past 1.5 years. As a founding member of the department, his mission was to find opportunities abroad and expand the business globally. During his time at CUC Inc., he was engaged in a variety of fields such as global market research, launching new business, M＆A, sales, and marketing, spanning both Asia and Africa. When he was in charge of establishing a new clinic, he realized the importance and impact of proper design in the success of the business.
He is an entrepreneurial person who has a passion to add value and happiness to people’s lives through business and hence contribute to making the world a better place. He is really excited about learning how to design in order to positively impact people and the environment, while drawing from the diverse backgrounds of the people in CIID.

It always seems impossible, until it’s done.</p>
